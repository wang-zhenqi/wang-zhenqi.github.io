Welcome to my site!

Here is a little space of my writing collections. I'll write and share some articles, short essays and experiances about my working and learning processes.

The name of this site - "Why does it work?" - is inspired by a widespread joke about programmer. It's really fun to discover why and how does a piece of code work and it makes me happy when I figure out ways to solve a problem. So I want to put here the things like "how to solve a problem", "the mechenism of an application", "take a deep dive into some techniques", etc.

The content would be in Chinese, English or bilingual, it's not likely to have translations of an article.

I'll try my best to make the content meaningful and well-organized, hope you can find something useful from this site.

Enjoy reading!
